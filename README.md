Wallbase Community Edition

This repository has been created in response to the requests of a number of the members of the Wallbase community 
to support the creation of a Wallbase alternative to serve as a new home in the event the current Wallbase ceases
to exist.

Anyone who wishes to contribute will find the discussion in the issues here at github and at our [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wallbasece).
